# Service Outage Postmortem

## Issue Summary

- **Duration**: 2023-09-10 14:30 - 2023-09-10 15:45 (UTC)

- **Impact**:
  - **Service(s) Affected**: Web application, API services
  - **User Experience**: Users experienced a significant slowdown in response times, with some requests failing.
  - **Percentage of Users Affected**: Approximately 30% of our user base was affected during the outage.

- **Root Cause**: The root cause of the outage was identified as a database connection pool exhaustion due to a sudden spike in user traffic. This resulted in increased database query times, leading to slow application performance and intermittent failures.

## Timeline

- **Issue Detection Time**: 2023-09-10 14:30 (UTC)

- **Detection Method**: The issue was initially detected through monitoring alerts, which indicated a high rate of database connection failures.

- **Actions Taken**:
  - Our engineering team quickly investigated the issue, focusing on the application servers and the database.
  - Initially, we assumed that a misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings might be causing the problem.

- **Misleading Paths**:
  - At one point, we suspected a potential DDoS attack and spent some time investigating traffic patterns. This led to a temporary delay in identifying the actual cause.

- **Escalation**:
  - The incident was escalated to the database administration team when it became clear that the issue was related to the database.

- **Resolution**:
  - To resolve the issue, we increased the maximum connection pool size and tuned the database configuration to handle a higher load efficiently. This alleviated the connection pool exhaustion, restoring normal service operation.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause**:
The root cause was traced to an unexpectedly high number of concurrent user sessions, which exceeded the capacity of our database connection pool. As a result, when new connections were requested, they were delayed or denied, causing application slowness and failures.

**Resolution**:
We implemented the following steps to resolve the issue:
- Increased the maximum connection pool size to accommodate the surge in traffic.
- Tuned database parameters, optimizing query performance and resource allocation.
- Implemented automatic scaling of database resources during traffic spikes to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes**:
- Implement automated load testing to proactively identify capacity limits and bottlenecks.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to provide quicker detection of performance degradation.
- Develop a capacity planning strategy to ensure our systems can handle unexpected traffic surges.

**Specific Tasks**:
- Task 1: Implement automated load testing within the next two weeks to assess system scalability.
- Task 2: Enhance monitoring alerts for database performance, aiming for real-time detection of connection pool issues.
- Task 3: Establish a cross-functional team to conduct capacity planning and regularly review system scalability.
